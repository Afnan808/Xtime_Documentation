### Opinion Poll and Results
Based on the opinion poll, I found that the duration of using the program is short, so other features must be added that attract the user and enhance their enthusiasm to accomplish their tasks. The user must also be reminded to enter the program and motivated to accomplish tasks quickly and in an organized manner. As for evaluating the satisfaction rate, I found that it is neutral, so it is necessary to take users' notes about what is related to their satisfaction and to know the defect or problem they have.

## Summary
